# Infrastructure as Code
  
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the management and deployment of an infrastructure through code. By building the infrastructure through code, the advantages of code can be applied to the infrastructure.


Specific advantages are as follows.  

1️⃣ **Easy to Wirte**  
  Infrastructure can be built as quickly as writing general code.  
  
2️⃣ **Easy to Reuse**  
  When building a new environment based on previously built infrastructure, code can be reused.  
  
3️⃣ **Strong Maintainability**  
  Maintenance is improved by managing state with comparing code and real infrastructure.
